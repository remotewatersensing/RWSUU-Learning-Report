\section{Sensors}

The sensor package on the drone is equipped with a turbidity, conductivity, and acidity meter. A minimum accuracy and range requirement for these sensors will be established based on an use case provided by PERNAM JSC. Accuracy of these parameters will be measured both in the laboratory and in practice. All sensors are calibrated accordingly beforehand.
