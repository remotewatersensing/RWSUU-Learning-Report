\subsection{Conductivity}
As mentioned in the Design Report, the DFRobot DFR0300H \cite{DFR0300H} was chosen for measuring the conductivity. The manufacturer claims the sensor has an accuracy of 5\% FS, meaning with a range of 20ms/cm, it has an error of 1ms/cm.

\subsubsection{Known conductivity solutions}
Known conductivity solutions of 12.88ms/cm and 1.413ms/cm were used to determine the accuracy of the sensor.
